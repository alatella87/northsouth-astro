# Whirlpool Digital Consumer Experience

Northsouth partnered with Whirlpool to reimagine the digital experience for their high-end home appliances, creating an ecosystem that connects consumers with their products in meaningful ways throughout the ownership lifecycle.

## Project Overview

Whirlpool sought to enhance customer engagement and support through digital touchpoints. Our team conducted extensive user research to understand consumer needs at different stages of the product journey, from pre-purchase research to installation, usage, and maintenance. We then developed a comprehensive digital strategy and implemented solutions that address these needs.

## Technologies Used

- IoT integration for smart appliance connectivity
- Native mobile applications for iOS and Android
- Cloud infrastructure for data processing and analytics
- AI-powered troubleshooting and maintenance suggestions
- Augmented reality for installation guidance
- User behavior analytics for continuous improvement

## Results

The enhanced digital ecosystem has delivered substantial benefits for both Whirlpool and their customers:

- 48% increase in digital product registration rates
- 55% reduction in support calls through self-service troubleshooting
- 72% of users actively engage with the mobile app on a monthly basis
- Improved customer satisfaction scores, with NPS increasing by 18 points
